# 🧮 Decimal to Binary Converter - Algorithm Comparison

## 📊 Project Overview
A comprehensive Java project comparing three different algorithms for decimal-to-binary conversion with performance analysis.

## 🚀 Features
- **Three Algorithm Implementations**:
  - Division Method (Mathematical approach)
  - Bitwise Method (Computer-efficient approach) 
  - Recursive Method (Elegant functional approach)
- **Interactive Mode**: Real-time conversion with performance comparison
- **Performance Analysis**: Detailed timing statistics with visual charts
- **Cross-Validation**: All methods verified against Java's built-in `Integer.toBinaryString()`

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Compile & Run (Batch Mode)
```bash
cd src/main/java
javac com/selina/converter/NumberConverter.java
java com.selina.converter.NumberConverter

## **🔍 Key Technical Findings**

- Bitwise operations are most efficient for direct binary manipulation
- String concatenation in recursion causes significant performance overhead
- Java's built-in method is highly optimized (native implementation)
- All three custom methods produce identical results to the standard library

## **🎓 Learning Outcomes**

- Algorithm design and analysis
- Performance measurement techniques
- Recursion optimization strategies
- Java bit manipulation operations
- Software engineering best practices
