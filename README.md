# 🧮 Decimal to Binary Converter - Algorithm Comparison

## 📊 Project Overview
A comprehensive Java project comparing three different algorithms for decimal-to-binary conversion with performance analysis.

## 🚀 Features
- **Three Algorithm Implementations**:
  - Division Method (Mathematical approach)
  - Bitwise Method (Computer-efficient approach) 
  - Recursive Method (Elegant functional approach)
- **Interactive Mode**: Real-time conversion with performance comparison
- **Performance Analysis**: Detailed timing statistics with visual charts
- **Cross-Validation**: All methods verified against Java's built-in `Integer.toBinaryString()`

## 🔍 Key Technical Findings
1. **Bitwise operations** are most efficient for direct binary manipulation
2. **String concatenation in recursion** causes significant performance overhead  
3. **Java's built-in method** is highly optimized (native implementation)
4. **All three custom methods** produce identical results to the standard library

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes
- **Algorithm design and analysis**
- **Performance measurement techniques**  
- **Recursion optimization strategies**
- **Java bit manipulation operations**
- **Software engineering best practices**
